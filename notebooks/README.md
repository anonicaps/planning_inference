# Experiments

This folder contains all the scripts used in our experimental evaluation:

* **Experiments-domain.ipynb**: notebook to launch all problems in a domain.
* **Experiments-Test.ipynb**: notebook to launch a single deduction problem. It allows setting the domain, observability, type of deduction problem as well as some other parameters.
* **Evaluation.ipynb**: notebook to summarize the results after running the experiments.

# Benchmark description
The benchmark folder contains all the problems used in our experimental evaluation and is organized by domain, observability, and type of deduction problem. For each problem you will find the following files:

* **domain**: planning model description.
* **obs**: observation sequence.
* **hyp$**: hypothesis $.
* **sol**: contains the index of the correct hypothesis.

Additionally, you will also find some files generated by running the experiments scripts:

* **costs**: contains the costs associated to each hypothesis.
* **times**: contains the computation times associated to each hypothesis.
* **plan.$**: solution plan for hypothesis $.
